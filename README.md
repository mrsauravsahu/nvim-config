# @mrsauravsahu/nvim-config

This README file provides an overview and details about the configuration files for nvim using NvChad 

- The main nvchad repo [NvChad/NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules, like `require "nvchad.options", require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo (when you clone it locally) or fork it :)

# Credits

- Lazyvim starter https://github.com/LazyVim/starter as nvchad's starter was inspired by Lazyvim's. It made a lot of things easier!
